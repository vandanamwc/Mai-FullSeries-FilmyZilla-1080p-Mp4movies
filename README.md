Streaming and Download Options
Currently, there are options to download or watch "Mai" (2024) streaming the full movie online for free. If you enjoy movies, then you'll love the new romance movie "Swatantrya Veer Savarkar." This movie is one of the best in its genre. "#Mai" will be available to watch online on Netflix very soon! For those looking to download, "Mai" is available in Full HD on platforms like MPMovies (480p), FilmyZilla (480p, 720p), Filmywap, mp4moviez, and via Full HD Telegram links (1080p).

The highly anticipated "Mai" prequel will be available for streaming first on Starz for subscribers. Later, the movie will also be released on Peacock, thanks to an agreement between distributor Lionsgate and NBC Universal’s streaming platform. Determining the exact arrival date of the movie can be complex. Typically, Lionsgate movies, like John Wick 4, take approximately six months to become available on Starz, where they remain for a considerable period. As for when "Songbirds and Snakes" will be accessible on Peacock, it could take nearly a year after its release. However, we will only receive confirmation once Lionsgate makes an official announcement. If you wish to watch the movie even earlier, you can rent it on Video on Demand (VOD), likely available before the streaming date on Starz.

Box Office Performance
Warner Bros. is continuing to dominate the box office over the New Year’s holiday weekend. "Mai" has risen above "The Color Purple" and other films. With that success, Warner Bros. has claimed three of the top five slots at the domestic box office throughout the holiday season.

The Timothée Chalamet-starring musical added another $8.6 million on [date], up 32% from one week ago. The Paul King film has emerged as the theatrical favorite for the holidays, crossing $100 million domestically earlier this week. With a $119 million cumulative to date, the film continues to show strength and is projected to reach $300 million globally before the end of the year.

Movie Release Performance
Though it slid into second place on [date] with $6.75 million, Warner Bros.’ "Mai" fell 51% from its opening day last week. The latest and final entry in the current continuity of DC Comics adaptations has struggled, only reaching $65 million in its first week. The first "Aquaman," released in 2018, surpassed that figure in its opening weekend alone. Poor reviews and superhero fatigue have plagued "Lost Kingdom," which likely won’t even reach half the $335 million domestic total of its predecessor, much less justify a $205 million production budget.

Animated Films
Taking a close third place, Illumination and Universal’s "Mai" is maintaining its footing with $6.7 million on [date] after a muted $12 million debut last weekend. While "Mai" has underperformed so far, its 17% increase over last weekend remains encouraging, especially for an original animated film with a production budget of only $70 million.

Streaming Availability
Here’s when you can bring the magic of "Mai" into your home:

Peacock: Currently, you can stream all four original "Mai" movies on Peacock until the end of November. Availability may vary month to month, so make sure to take advantage of the current window.

DVD and Blu-ray Release
As of now, Warner Bros. has not revealed a specific date for the DVD, Blu-ray, and 4K Ultra HD release of "Mai." The first film in the series premiered in theaters in early September and was released on Blu-ray and DVD in December. It’s likely the sequel will follow a similar path, aiming for availability around the holiday season.
